# Call, Apply and Bind

## Bind:

Lets understand this with an example:


```

var car ={
  brand:'Hyundai',
  model:'Accent',
  getFullSpecs: function(){
    var fullspecs = this.brand + ' ' + this.model;
    return fullspecs
  }

}

var logCarSpecs = function(lang1, lang2){
  console.log('Logged' + ' ' + this.getFullSpecs())
  console.log(lang1 + ' ' + lang2 )
}

logCarSpecs('en', 'es')
```
#### Code Walkthrough:
- We create an object (car) having properties brand and model set to hyundai and Accent respectively.
- The car object also has a method getFullSpecs which returns the details of the car.
- Then we are creating a function expression logCarSpecs which logs the car details to the console.
- And then we invoke the function by writing logCarSpecs()

When we run this code, what we find is this:
<Image src='/images/undefinederror.png' width='600' height='80' />





**So why is this big fat error popping?**


#### Explanation:
When our function logCarSpecs runs, the js compiler sees  'this'.getFullSpecs() and  it
tries to find the getFullSpecs method in the global object (window).
One might ask why does the js engine try to **find the getFullSpecs in the window object?**
Because our function statement is lexically sitting on the window object and 'this' inside a function 
refers to the global object.

Now since the global object doesnt have a function called getFullSpecs it returns with an undefined error in the console.


#### How do we fix this:

We want the 'this' keyword to point to the  car object.

Here comes the bind method.
The bind method takes two arguments:
- The thisArg
- Optional args [will talk about that later]

Whatever value we pass as the first parameter to the **bind function it points the this keyword to the value 
(usually an object) that we passed in as the first paramter**.If a primitive value is passed as the thisArg,
it gets automatically converted to an object.


Now if we pass the car object to the bind function
```
var bindedSpecs = logCarSpecs.bind(car)
bindedSpecs('en', 'es')
```

Lets run the code
<Image src='/images/bindresult.png' width='600' height='200' />
Boom! We get the result that we wanted





export default ({ children }) => <CustomLayout >{children}</CustomLayout>;
